DirectFB wrapper for Linux Framebuffer applications
---------------------------------------------------

The DirectFB-fbdev package contains the dfbfbdev wrapper which starts the
specified application and redirects frame buffer device access (/dev/fb0)
to DirectFB calls.

dfbfbdev uses the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, the fbdev wrapping is
done in the libdfbfbdev.so library.

Have fun,
